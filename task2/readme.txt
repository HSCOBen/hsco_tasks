End goal ... for all digital designs, display mapped images to our customers ... to help them understand the scale (repeat) of the design

Placement of the design on the mapped image is important on select designs; specifically those that are bigger. In creating the mapped
image with a design, use multiple start points ... this way we can select which looks best. Ex: Create (10) mapped
images for a design, all at different start points - then Lindsay picks which one she likes the best. How to pick the start points?
